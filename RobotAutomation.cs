Please note that the above examples provide a general structure for implementing subject following and person recognition. The actual implementation will depend on the specific computer vision libraries, object detection models, and machine learning models you choose to use. You will need to integrate appropriate libraries such as OpenCV for computer vision tasks and use trained models for object detection and person recognition.

Additionally, you will need to configure and connect the robot's hardware components for movement and integrate with appropriate APIs or SDKs to control the robot's actuators or motors.

These examples serve as a starting point, and you would need to adapt and extend the code based on your specific requirements and the libraries or frameworks you choose to use for computer vision and machine learning.
